## Connector Reference Stub (raw/)

Used for Outlook emails, Teams chats/channel messages, and Teams meeting transcripts. Per data governance policy, these sources are **never stored verbatim** in `raw/`. A `.ref.md` stub is saved instead, providing retrieval keys so the content can be re-fetched via connector. Derived Brain pages (meeting pages, notes, decisions) point their `raw_source:` frontmatter at this stub.

**File naming**: `raw/YYYY-MM-DD-descriptive-slug.ref.md`

```markdown
---
title: <subject> — Connector Reference
type: connector-reference
source_system: teams-transcript | outlook-email | teams-chat
date: YYYY-MM-DD
# System-specific retrieval keys (include whichever apply):
meeting_subject: ""
organizer: ""
attendees: []
event_id: ""
online_meeting_id: ""
recording_url: ""
chat_deep_link: ""
message_id: ""
email_search_query: ""

# <subject> — Connector Reference

**This is a reference stub — content is NOT stored here, per data governance policy.**

**To retrieve:** <exact connector tool + ID/URI/search query to re-pull the content>
**Fallback:** <e.g. search Outlook calendar for "<subject>" on <date>; ask the user to paste>
**Retention note:** source content expires per the source system's retention policy; once expired, rely on the derived Brain pages below.

**Derived pages:** [[pm/meetings/YYYY-MM-DD-meeting-slug]]
